# About
This is a remake of Deltarune's battle system in Godot 4 that I've been working on for the past few weeks. Its still missing some major features like sound effects and magic, but I plan to add some of those soon. Feel free to open any issues or pull requests, I should be able to get to them fairly quickly.

I made this project mainly for this video (which explains what decisions I made and what I learned along the way): https://youtu.be/KmVrpzoq95o.

If you're not sure whether you want to use this system yet, I've exported a basic demo scene out to itch.io that you can play right in your browser: https://devpoodle.itch.io/delta-battle.
